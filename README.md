# hello-world
start of something new

My name is Levett, username Element or vettMdub, starting my journey into python programming, want to try making sense of AI coding and writting some myself.
So this is my hello world start of the events to come from it. 

My ideas for an AI I am looking to create would be able to:
  Chatbot- AI that is capable of maintaing a converstation and deciding what to say to users based on their comments.
            Multiple langagues capable of understanding and speaking to clients in their native langague
            Professional more that can be adapated to greeting customers at docotors offices, store fronts or general clerical locations.
            Example a chatbot that can not only understand what a client is saying or requestig but also capable of sensing emotions or levels of distres in speaking patterns.
              so if a patient enters a hospital the AI could collect the patient's data to create new patient profiles or in the event of previous patient prepare their data for                 doctors/inssurances from voice recogiznations, fingerprints, or other identifying markers and begin to Triage the level of response needed from doctors to help the                 patient with the issues they tell the AI are troubling them. 
  Speech to Text AI - AI that is capable to writing what is spoken to it, facilitate the transition of what people say to the AI to the chatbot for the AI to make a proper                               response, and vice versa to be sent to the Deepfake voice AI to speak what the chatbot says. Can also help in providing subtitles during converstations with                        AI to make sure everything is understood in the clearest manner.  
  Deepfake Voice - AI that can replicate a humans voice to match a input persons voice, combined with the chatbot to make the response auditory.
                Again with the MD office example the AI could take on the voice of the doctor that is currently in the office, a docotor who might not speak Spanish or Manderin                    could treat patients who do and provide their own explanations of what is wrong and what the patient needs to do to get better in their own langangue.
 Speech to Drawing - AI that can determine what is being said and create ilistrations based on the converstation to provide visual examples to help convey meaning and better                   understanding. 
                Once more with the doctors office example, if a doctor is explain to a patient they have broken their right side, 3rd True rib, an AI that would be cabable of                      drawing what the doctor is explaining on the patient's XRay. If the doctor expalins what the patient should avoid doing or moving in certain directions the AI 
                 could illistrate the movements to avoid taking.
